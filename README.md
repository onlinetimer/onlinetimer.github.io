Perfect for lazy people like me! Online Timer visualy shows how much of your day has been wasted! 

Finally made myself a proper timer to track my studying. 
I tried many different things, but none motivated me to study more than this timer has.

full circle represents 24 hours and when the the timer starts it leaves a green arcy so that at the end of the day,
you are left with a "cake diagram" of you activity.
